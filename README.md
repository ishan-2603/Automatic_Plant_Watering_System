# Automatic_Plant_Watering_System
The automatic plant watering system uses an Arduino and soil moisture sensor to maintain optimal soil moisture. When the soil is dry, the sensor activates a relay to turn on a water pump. Once the moisture reaches a set level, the pump is automatically turned off, ensuring efficient water use.
