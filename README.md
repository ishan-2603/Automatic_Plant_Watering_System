# Automatic_Plant_Watering_System
The automatic plant watering system uses an Arduino and soil moisture sensor to maintain optimal soil moisture. When the soil is dry, the sensor activates a relay to turn on a water pump. Once the moisture reaches a set level, the pump is automatically turned off, ensuring efficient water use. 

The automatic plant watering system is an Arduino-based project designed to automate the irrigation process and maintain ideal soil moisture levels for plants. The system consists of several key components: an Arduino microcontroller, a soil moisture sensor, a relay module, a water pump, connecting wires, and power supply.

# Workflow 

## Soil Moisture Detection
The soil moisture sensor continuously measures the moisture level in the soil by detecting its electrical conductivity. As the moisture content varies, the sensor outputs corresponding analog voltage signals, which are read by the Arduino.

## Data Processing and Decision Making
The Arduino is programmed to compare the sensorâ€™s readings with a predefined moisture threshold. If the moisture level is below the set threshold, indicating that the soil is too dry, the Arduino activates the relay module.

## Water Pump Activation
The relay, functioning as an electronic switch, connects the water pump to the power supply when activated. This action turns on the water pump, allowing water to flow to the plant until the soil moisture reaches the desired level.

## Automatic Pump Shutdown
As the soil absorbs water, the sensor detects the increase in moisture content. When the moisture level exceeds the defined threshold, the Arduino deactivates the relay, turning off the water pump. This ensures that the plant receives adequate water without overwatering.

## Looping Operation
The system continuously monitors soil moisture in real-time, repeating the process to maintain optimal soil conditions.

The project's design ensures efficient water usage by delivering water only when needed, minimizing waste and overwatering risks. The automation significantly reduces manual effort and supports the healthy growth of plants. This setup can be adapted for various applications, such as home gardens, potted plants, and agricultural fields, providing a scalable and cost-effective irrigation solution.
